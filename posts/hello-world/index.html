This will probably be my longest post of all.\nI have given my services for 5 years at this organization. I was the 16th employee of STPL. I still clearly remember the day when I got placed in STPL. It was rainy day at Starbucks, Indiranagar, Bangalore with Rohan Gupta, CTO, STPL and Ratan Kumar, VP Engineering, STPL.\nLet’s go back a litte in my journey.\nI was born in Ranchi, Jharkhand. My father, Lallan Kumar Tiwary, is a proffessor in chemistry department of R.I.E (Regional Institute of Education).\nHave gotten beaten by him a lot during my upbringing. My parents were probably the strictest parents you could ever meet. My mother is a school teacher.\nShe teaches in Kopal Higher Secondary School, Bhopal. I was a very naughty kid when I was growing up, and my parents had realized the fact very soon, hence they were a control freak. I can today proudly say that whatever I have become is because of them. I hope they are proud of me too. Now, we don’t talk like we used to when I was growing up.\nI did my primary schooling in a Chhattisgarh board school. We used to live on rent throughout my childhood, starting from pre primary till 11th standard.\nLong story short my parents moved from Dhamtari (place near Raipur) to Bhopal and I got admission in Bal Bhavan School.\nI used to struggle a lot during my school days. Coming from a small city to a capital city was no easy. Fellow classmates used to judge my English accent like anything. “Umang pronounces Madam and Medem” were the type of comments I used to hear. But I made a lot of friends, had a lot of crushes - nothing materialized ever. Had no phone till 11th standard. We used live in RIE campus which was around 2-3 kms from Bal Bhavan School. I got interested in Mathematics during my 8th-9th standard and I was so addicted with solving NCERT, RD Sharma, RS Agrawal books that I used to complete my syllabus in mid term itself and finish up 6-7 notebooks of 300 - 400 pages each.\nThose were crazy times (2007-2011). So much competition, and I was clueless. I had to take science stream. There was no other option. I enrolled myself in a JEE coaching institute called Vision Infinity Private Limited. Life got so, so hectic. I once remember my mother telling me that “Hey! You have started blabbering physics formulas in your sleep. Are you ok?\". I said “Yeah. All is good”. But the fact of the matter was that I was not feeling ok with the competitive nature of the students near me. Students used to behave very differently and call each other with random names and judge each other on the basis of weekly or monthly tests.\nAt the end I was not able to qualify for either JEE nor AIEEE. Luckily I had gotten to know about an exam called BITSAT which students and teachers used to consider sub-par as compared to other exams since BITS Pilani is a private institute with extra ordinarily high fees as compared to other government institutions. Sat in that exam, did not get good marks again. I got 294 out 360 in which you could only get streams like Chemical Engineering of dual degree programs. Had no other choice but to join BITS Pilani Goa Campus.\nLife in BITS was very different. There were kids who spoke different languages, came from different parts of the country and lived together in single campus. There was no concept of out-hostel. You had to live inside the campus. Goa campus, amongst other 3 (Pilani, Hyderabad and Dubai), is known for its diverse culture and inter-disciplinary courses. The amount of freedom one gets in just insane. Since it was Goa, there were again strict rules and regulations again.\nI still carry some of the books from our curriculum like Modern Political Concepts by Andrew Heywood, Introduction to Probability and Statistics, Signals and Systems, Control Systems Engineering etc. You never know what can help when! An interesting fact is that I was enrolled in Chemical Engineering department then got upgraded to Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering. 1st and 2nd year were good - scored decent marks. Students were into competition again, but this time I decided not to focus on competition and only focus on studying what I like and leave rest of it.\nMy best friends from campus are living in Bangalore happily. Saurabh Nigam is one of them. He comes from almost the same background as I do. I loved teaching him during college days. He used to miss a lot of classes which I used to attend, and 1 day/night before the exams, we used revised the entire syllabus together. I still remember the day when I got very high marks in Signals and Systems course and I couldn’t teach him well the day before - but we cheated during the exams. And he also got exactly same as me. We copied each other’s answer sheet point by point. Rest of the students were jealous with us on that day.\nBut 3rd and 4th year happened. Life derailed very quickly. From 6.5 - 7 pointer out 10, I suddenly became a 5 pointer. It was struggle to score well in exams. I used to feel amused when students scored 8-9 points. I used to tell lies to my parents about the marks I scored. But I never got a back in any subject. Lowest I would have gotten is 4 points in a subject which used to be considered as “pass”. I saw a lot of students getting de-railed during that phase. I used to empathize with them.\nFinally after all this, I got an internship opportunity at Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, DRDO, Bangalore in my 4th year/1st semester in 2016. This was the first time I met students from all three campuses. We had crazy time.\nI’ll tell you a crazy discrimination in terms of pay - students who had more than 7 CGPA were paid a sum total of 60000 for working for 6 months, and students below that CGPA were not paid anything. I was dependent on my father’s income again. I had hoped for something else though. But all being said, I used enjoy my work a lot. I used to work with my mentor to assist him in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping Algorithm. Problem statement was - Say you have a robot with all the sensons installed in it. Now if a map is given to that robot, it should be very easy to navigate in the area, right? - since the map is known. Now let’s say the robot is given the initial coordinates and the map is not given, again it should be able to navigate itself in area, detecting obstacles and move along. The core problem statement which my mentor, Shashank Bushan, was trying to solve was that - say both the map and initial coordinates are not given, how will the robot navigate? Advanced stuff! I had a great time working with him and he’ll always be in my thoughts.\n4th year/2nd semester was placement season for us. I did not get placed in any of that D0 - D8 companies. Finally got an offer from Sabre Travel Solutions Private Limited, the same company where my friend Saurabh Nigam got placed. We were very happy. I told myself that at least now life can start afresh and we all can start earning and live independently. But you know, life challenges you at each moment of time and one must be ready to take those challenges. Sabre had some corporate re-structuring going on at that time, and they were not handing over our offer letters till very late. All the students who got their jobs with me were already sitting happily in their flats/apartments and earning huge bucks - and here I was, sitting and waiting for my offer letter. But nothing could be done. I fought with my parents and again came to Bangalore. This was June, 2017.\nI started preparing for coding interviews along with my friend Antrisk Vijay and Gaurav Narula, both extremely smart and intelligent people. I got to know about STPL via angel list and randomly applied.\nI forgot to tell you about one my good experience with a startup called Ensieg - Uber for sports grounds. They are shut now, but I had gone to Hyderabad to work with them for 1 month. That’s where I got addicted to 0 to 1 problem solving. Trust me, it’s an addiction which is very difficult to get out of. Playo used to be our competitor, but because of some reason the idea couldn’t fly. I still remember those sleepless nights spent to see PIIs of beta signed up users.\nComing back to STPL. I had great conversation with the CTO and VP. They called me in Starbucks, Indiranagar for the final round where I was not expecting any technical question, but CTO surprised me with 2-3 hour long technical discussion. I was sweating in AC, not able to eat anything they offered. But they liked me somehow and decided to give me the offer letter. Meanwhile in Sabre, HR team had woken up and had started calling us for joining date and pre-onboarding rituals. Now I was in dilemma of where to give my services. That’s where Gaurav Narula helped me decide and navigate through the stock market industry, or simply put fintech industry. I still remember the day when I had 2 offer letter in hand and I to tear 1 down and sign on another. I chose STPL. Both had same starting salary, so the decision became really difficult.\nMy journey in STPL started as an entry level software engineer in a small office of Zerodha 3rd floor. I used to live in 1 RB (room bathroom) in Jayanagar, not event 250 sq feet area, but the balcony was good. Having a smoke in morning time was refreshing. I used to walk down to the office, around 2-3 kms and come back via an auto rickshaw. I did all sorts of work, starting from helping set up data pipelines in Mongodb, creating APIs for front facing products, writing CRON jobs and scheduling them. There were 3 people who worked on code back then - me, Ratan Kumar and Rohan Gupta.\nOur team started expanding within 6-8 months and we had to move out of Zerodha’s office. Founders decided to take a rented office in Indiqube building near Richmond Road, Bangalore. I met super intelligent and motivate folks during initial phase of scaling STPL. We went from 10k users to 1 lakh users during this phase. We used work for very long hours, around 12-14 hrs. We partied a lot too. It was like living with a philosophy of “work hard, part harder”.\nLife has been on auto-pilot since then, I’ll talk more our scaling journey in further blogs. But that’s all for now.\nWhy this blog website?\nI have too much free time now a days. And I can afford to story-tell the journey of STPL, Tickertape and Windmill Capital. But that’s all for now. Thanks for reading through.\n",

<p>I am Umang Tiwary, Senior Software Engineer at smallcase Technologies Private Limited (STPL). This will probably be my longest post of all.</p>
<p>I have given my services for 5 years at this organization. I was the 16th employee of STPL. I still clearly remember the day when I got placed in STPL. It was rainy day at Starbucks, Indiranagar, Bangalore with Rohan Gupta, CTO, STPL and Ratan Kumar, VP Engineering, STPL.</p>

Finally got an offer from Sabre Travel Solutions Private Limited, the same company where my friend Saurabh Nigam got placed. We were very happy. I told myself that at least now life can start afresh and we all can start earning and live independently. But you know, life challenges you at each moment of time and one must be ready to take those challenges. Sabre had some corporate re-structuring going on at that time, and they were not handing over our offer letters till very late. All the students who got their jobs with me were already sitting happily in their flats/apartments and earning huge bucks - and here I was, sitting and waiting for my offer letter. But nothing could be done. I fought with my parents and again came to Bangalore. This was June, 2017.</p>
<p>I started preparing for coding interviews along with my friend Antrisk Vijay and Gaurav Narula, both extremely smart and intelligent people. I got to know about STPL via angel list and randomly applied.</p>
<p>I forgot to tell you about one my good experience with a startup called Ensieg - Uber for sports grounds. They are shut now, but I had gone to Hyderabad to work with them for 1 month. That&rsquo;s where I got addicted to 0 to 1 problem solving. Trust me, it&rsquo;s an addiction which is very difficult to get out of. Playo used to be our competitor, but because of some reason the idea couldn&rsquo;t fly. I still remember those sleepless nights spent to see PIIs of beta signed up users.</p>
<p>Coming back to STPL. I had great conversation with the CTO and VP. They called me in Starbucks, Indiranagar for the final round where I was not expecting any technical question, but CTO surprised me with 2-3 hour long technical discussion. I was sweating in AC, not able to eat anything they offered. But they liked me somehow and decided to give me the offer letter. Meanwhile in Sabre, HR team had woken up and had started calling us for joining date and pre-onboarding rituals. Now I was in dilemma of where to give my services. That&rsquo;s where Gaurav Narula helped me decide and navigate through the stock market industry, or simply put fintech industry. I still remember the day when I had 2 offer letter in hand and I to tear 1 down and sign on another. I chose STPL. Both had same starting salary, so the decision became really difficult.</p>
<p>My journey in STPL started as an entry level software engineer in a small office of Zerodha 3rd floor. I used to live in 1 RB (room bathroom) in Jayanagar, not event 250 sq feet area, but the balcony was good. Having a smoke in morning time was refreshing. I used to walk down to the office, around 2-3 kms and come back via an auto rickshaw. I did all sorts of work, starting from helping set up data pipelines in Mongodb, creating APIs for front facing products, writing CRON jobs and scheduling them. There were 3 people who worked on code back then - me, Ratan Kumar and Rohan Gupta.</p>
<p>Our team started expanding within 6-8 months and we had to move out of Zerodha&rsquo;s office. Founders decided to take a rented office in Indiqube building near Richmond Road, Bangalore. I met super intelligent and motivate folks during initial phase of scaling STPL. We went from 10k users to 1 lakh users during this phase. We used work for very long hours, around 12-14 hrs. We partied a lot too. It was like living with a philosophy of &ldquo;work hard, part harder&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Life has been on auto-pilot since then, I&rsquo;ll talk more our scaling journey in further blogs. But that&rsquo;s all for now.</p>
<p>Why this blog website?</p>
<p>I have too much free time now a days. And I can afford to story-tell the journey of STPL, Tickertape and Windmill Capital. But that&rsquo;s all for now. Thanks for reading through.</p>
