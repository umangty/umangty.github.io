      <description>Reading and writing is one of the most important habits one can acquire. It helps one analyse the history, civics and geography of the topic in hand. The kind of satisfaction, or for the lack of better word, high, one can get from book reading is immense. I never got interested in reading books till I was 18-19 years old. I used to see my father putting a lot of effort in creating reading materials for his students.</description>

      <description>I am Umang Tiwary, a Senior Software Engineer at smallcase Technologies Private Limited (STPL). This will probably be my longest post of all. So hold on and read along.
I have given my services for 5 years at this organization. I was the 16th employee of STPL (SC0016). I still clearly remember the day when I got placed in STPL. It was a rainy day at Starbucks, Indiranagar, Bangalore with the CTO and VP of Engineering, STPL.</description>
